# Overview

This is a simple TypeScript project designed as a starting point to get comfortable with the TypeScript development environment. The goal was to create a basic "Hello World" application using TypeScript to ensure everything—from tooling setup to running the code—is working as expected.

The purpose of this project is to lay the foundation for future TypeScript projects by establishing a minimal yet functional structure, including a build system, type configuration, and script execution using `ts-node`.
